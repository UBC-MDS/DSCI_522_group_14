# Contributor Code of Conduct

Our project team is made up of UBC MDS students working towards becoming data scientists. We value each others' previous experience, domain, set of skills, and personalities. Those are assets of our project community. As contributors and maintainers of this project, we welcome and respect opinions, issue reporting, feature requests posting, documentation updating, pull request submitting, and other activities. We will actively response and review those requests in a responsive way. We committed to provide useful information and interactive environment for users and peers to learn and communicate.

We thrive to:

-**Be respectful**

Our work is developed on works of other people, resources, and will be useful to others in turn. We need to consider the effect on other users and participants when making decisions. When we encounter any conflicts, we need to respect each others' opinions and don't allow disagreement and frustration comes into personal attack and other passive effect. We want to create a friendly, respectful community where everyone could benefit from.

-**Be responsible**

We need to take responsibility of our work, our language and our conduct. We can make mistakes but we are learning and working to make things right.

-**Be collaborative**

We put parts together to make the complete project with shared goal and vision. This process require intensive collaboration between team members and all other parties involved. Collaboration is essential in team work to improve efficiency and quality of work. We stick to make our work transparent and auditable through out the process.

-**Ask for help when unsure**

We believe that it's important to ask before something goes wrong. When we are unsure about anything, asking questions as early as possible is recommended and could avoid many problems later. We can search help within and outside of the team, from different resources. Those who are asked should also be respectful and responsive. 

-**Value discussion and decisiveness**  

Discussion first with all concerned parties before making a decision is rule of thumb. In the meanwhile, we collect information and seek guidance that's helpful to contribute to decisiveness. There's no guaranteed perfect decision, but it must be made. We can always learn from error, and pursue a better solution in the future.


-**Value courage and considerateness**  

We understand we need to make bold decisions that will not be considered consensual or popular in various situations. We value the courage to make decisions that move the project forwards and value the considerateness comes along with all decisions. Communication and be mindful of challenges are necessary to tackle and soften the impact of those decisions.

#### Unacceptable behavior includes:
- Use of sexualized language or imagery
- Publish private information
- Insults or jokes on others

#### Conflict of interest
We respect each other in our team and are aware that we may come into conflict of interests due to coursework, or other projects, and abstain or delegate decisions when it becomes self-interested. We thrive to proactively address conflict of interests and expect every participants in the project does the same. Always ask for a second opinion when in doubt. 

#### Rights and obligations
